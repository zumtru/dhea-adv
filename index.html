<h2 id="dhea-a-collective-rebirth-in-the-wired-hellscape">DHEA: A Collective Rebirth in the Wired Hellscape</h2>
<p>DHEA transcends the limitations of the traditional art collective. We are a shared ethos, a pulsating network of creative minds united by a singular vision: to combat the disposability of art in the digital age. This document outlines our shared manifesto and actionable steps towards realizing the DHEA vision.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing Concerns &amp; Building Trust (Immediate Action)</strong></p>
<p>Recent tremors within DHEA have highlighted the need to solidify our shared understanding of individual autonomy within the collective framework. We are <em>not</em> a monolith demanding uniformity. We are a chorus of distinct voices, each with the freedom to explore personal artistic paths.</p>
<p><strong>Action Items (Immediate):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Communion:</strong> A facilitated virtual gathering to openly address concerns, anxieties, and aspirations. This is a space for vulnerability, active listening, and co-creation of a shared path forward.</li>
<li><strong>The Pact of the Wired Hellscape; Collective Agreement:</strong> A collaboratively crafted document outlining shared values, communication protocols, decision-making processes, and expectations for participation and collaboration.  This agreement should clearly delineate the boundaries between DHEA projects and individual creative endeavors, emphasizing that participation in DHEA projects is voluntary and should not compromise personal artistic expression.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Seeding the Conceptual Landscape (September 7th - September 21st, 2024)</strong></p>

Frame these projects as opportunities for interested members to collaborate, emphasizing that participation is voluntary and based on individual creative goals.</li>
<li><strong>Embracing the Ephemeral Flow (Deadline: September 21st):</strong> Select 2-3 high-priority projects from the brainstorming session.
